WebXR finger guns
========================================================================
👋 Ahoy.  
  
I’m [Stewart](https://stewartsmith.io).
This demo illustrates the use of the
[WebXR device hand input API](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-hand-input/blob/master/explainer.md)
for hand and finger tracking,
as tested on an
[Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/quest/)
stand-alone headset.
Make your hand into a “finger gun” 
then tap your thumb down 
to shoot lasers from your index finger.
This experience is live at 
[https://stewartsmith.io/studies/vr-hands/](https://stewartsmith.io/studies/vr-hands/).
This code is open-source and available at
[https://github.com/stewdio/vr-hands](https://github.com/stewdio/vr-hands).  
  
  
If you have a Quest handy
you’ll need to follow these steps before you can 
experience the demo yourself:

1. In Oculus **settings**
enable automatic switching between regular hand controlles
and bare hands.

2. In the Oculus **browser**
visit [chrome://flags/](chrome://flags/).

3. Within the flags page, **enable** the 
“WebXR experiences with joints tracking” flag
(`#webxr-hands`).

4. Within the flags page, **disable** 
the “WebXR experiences with hands tracking” flag
(`#webxr-hands-tracking`).
Yes. _Disable_ it.
We’re at that funny early stage of the technology where 
things are not always what they seem.

5. Restart the Oculus browser
and visit this site again.
Use your hand controllers 
to click the “Enter VR” button.
Once you are inside the experience put your controllers down,
hold your hands out in front of you 
so that the headset can see them,
and enjoy! 😄
